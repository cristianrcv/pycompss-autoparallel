# Cholesky


## Description

"In linear algebra, the Cholesky decomposition or Cholesky factorization is a 
decomposition of a Hermitian, positive-definite matrix into the product of a
lower triangular matrix and its conjugate transpose, which is useful for 
efficient numerical solutions, e.g. Monte Carlo simulations."
