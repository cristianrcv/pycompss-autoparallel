# Jacobi - 2D


## Description

"In numerical linear algebra, the Jacobi method (or Jacobi iterative method) is an
algorithm for determining the solutions of a diagonally dominant system of linear
equations. Each diagonal element is solved for, and an approximate value is plugged
in. The process is then iterated until it converges. This algorithm is a stripped-down
version of the Jacobi transformation method of matrix diagonalization. The method
is named after Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi."
